\textbf{Lemma 2 (Sum Simplification Lemma):} Given a binary number $k$ with bits $k_i$, where $k_i$ is either 0 or 1, and positive integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n > m$, the sum

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-m} 3k(n-i)2^{n-i} + 2^m
\]

can be simplified to:

\[
2^m - 3k(2^{m+1} - 2^{n+1} - 2^m m + 2^{n+1} n)
\]

This is not a sum of geometric series, but it is a combination of terms involving powers of 2. The terms involving $k$ are multiplied by a difference of powers of 2, and the term $2^m$ is a power of 2.
