
\textbf{Lemma (Binary Decomposition Lemma):} Given a binary number $k$ with bits $k_i$, where $k_i$ is either 0 or 1, the operation of multiplying $k$ by 3, shifting it left $n$ places, and adding $2^m$ can be decomposed into separate operations on each bit of $k$, plus the final addition of $2^m$. Specifically, we have:

\[
3k \times 2^n + 2^m = \sum_{i=0}^{n} 3k_i 2^{i+n} + 2^m
\]

Each term in the sum is either 0 (if $k_i = 0$) or $3 \times 2^{i+n}$ (if $k_i = 1$).
