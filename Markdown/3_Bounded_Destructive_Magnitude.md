## Bounded Destructive Magnitude: Formal Justification (Extended)

In this section, we extend the analysis of the destructive mode of the Collatz process to provide a formal justification for the bounded magnitude of the destructive mode. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate that the magnitude of the destructive mode, represented by the number of divisions by 2 (i.e., the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation), is bounded for any given positive integer.

### Theorem (Bounded Destructive Magnitude)

The magnitude of the destructive mode of the Collatz process is bounded for any given positive integer.

### Proof

Let \( N \) be an odd positive integer with binary representation \( (b_n b_{n-1} \ldots b_1)_2 \), where \( b_i \) are binary digits and \( b_1 = 1 \). We consider the last \( L \) LSBs of \( N \), denoted as \( N_L = (b_L b_{L-1} \ldots b_1)_2 \), where \( L \geq 1 \).

We define the magnitude of the destructive mode, \( R(N) \), as the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of \( C(N) \), where \( C(N) = 3N + 1 \) is the result of applying the constructive function to \( N \).

To analyze the boundedness of the destructive magnitude, we consider the binary representation of \( C(N) \) and observe that the number of trailing zeros in \( C(N) \) is determined by the number of consecutive least significant bits equal to 1 in the binary representation of \( N \). Specifically, the magnitude \( R(N) \) is equal to the length of the longest sequence of consecutive least significant bits equal to 1 in \( N \).

Since \( N \) is an odd positive integer, its binary representation always ends with a 1. Therefore, the minimum value of \( R(N) \) is 1, which occurs when \( N \) has no consecutive least significant bits equal to 1 (e.g., \( N = 101 \)).

The maximum value of \( R(N) \) occurs when all the least significant bits of \( N \) are equal to 1. In this case, \( R(N) \) is equal to the number of least significant bits in \( N \). Since the binary representation of \( N \) is finite, the maximum value of \( R(N) \) is also finite and bounded.

In conclusion, the magnitude of the destructive mode of the Collatz process is bounded for any given positive integer. The minimum value of the magnitude is 1, and the maximum value is determined by the number of least significant bits in the binary representation of the positive integer. This analysis provides a formal justification for the bounded destructive magnitude in the Collatz process.
